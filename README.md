# shop-php-assesment
We can't wait for you to show your best when finishing our assesment!

Please pay attention to the following:

- You should be able to add different products to your cart
- You should be able to set the quantity of the products
- You should be able to enter your shipping and billing adress

- BONUS: add the option to add a discount coupon to your cart
- BONUS TIP: You are applying for a job as a PHP Backend Developper (Think about security, testability and separation of concerns)

An extra comment out of me as a recruiter: I Know that our Team Lead wants good documentation of your code, and also make sure to work via the OOP principle.

Good Luck
